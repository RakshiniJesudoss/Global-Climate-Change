# Global-Climate-Change

# INTRODUCTION
The Earth is warming up, and humans are at least partially to blame. The gradual increase in
the planet's surface temperature is known as global warming. Although this warming trend
has been around for a while, the burning of fossil fuels has greatly accelerated its pace over
the past century. The amount of fossil fuels burned has increased along with the size of the
human population. Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas results in the
"greenhouse effect," which affects the atmosphere of Earth.
These greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, methane,
and nitrous oxide. Our ecology and wildlife are being destroyed by the over usage of fossil
fuels. Due to the significant pollution this activity produces and the resulting ozone layer
damage, it also poses a serious threat to human life.

# STRATEGIC-LEVEL QUESTIONS:
1. Why is the earth getting hotter?
2. Which industry adds to global warming the most?
3. What can be done to reduce global warming?

# CONCLUSION:
From tableau visualization, we found that CO2 is the leading contributor to the increase in
global warming, United States is found to produce highest volume of CO2 and the major
cause of it is from electricity. Therefore, switching to alternate renewable sources like wind
and solar energy can help reduce the impact of global warming on the planet.
Climate change is an issue for humans right now, and people are the ones who are fueling
these conflicts. Although it is impossible to completely stop global warming, people may still
take steps to lessen and slow it down.
